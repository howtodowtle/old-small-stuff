+ `schafkopf_wkeiten.R` calculates useful probabilities for the traditional Bavarian card game [Schafkopf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schafkopf). The game can be played online at [sauspiel.de](https://www.sauspiel.de).
+ `optimal location cph.R`, used to find a good place for where to look for rooms in Copenhagen, depending on which spots I frequent and how often. No public transport or bikepaths included, just Euclidian distance.
